Project Feed Reader Udacity
--------------------------


In this project we were given a ready code that reads RSS feeds. The code had to be amended in order to get the Jasmine testing working correctly. This is a basic RSS feed reader created as part of Udacity's Front-End Nano Degree.

Viewing the project

Download the code. You can open this test by opening the index.html file in the browser of your choice. The test should pass automatically. In case of failures, you will see those at the bottom of the page.
